# [Install it!](https://docs.opencast.org/r/5.x/admin/installation/)
Opencast runs on Linux or MacOS servers. There are repositories with binaries available for CentOS (RPM) and Debian (DEB) like distributions. There are also Docker images available. If none of this works for you, you also find a detailed guide on how to build Opencast yourself.
